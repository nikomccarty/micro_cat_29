Microtubules are intracellular filaments, responsible for shuttling cargo throughout the cellular interior. When viewed under the microscope in the presence of ATP, microtubules can be observed slowly growing, then rapidly collapsing, as they explore the environment around them.

This latter feat -- rapid collapse -- is a process known as "microtubule catastrophe". To explore this phenomenon in a quantitative manner, Melissa K. Gardner, Marija Zanic, Christopher Gell, Volker Bormuth and Jonathan Howard performed experiments that uncovered a role for the kinesins, Kip3 and MCAK, in controlling microtubule catastrophe.

The paper is by Gardner MK, _et al._ "Depolymerizing Kinesins Kip3 and MCAK Shape Cellular Microtubule Architecture by Differential Control of Catastrophe" _Cell_ (2011).

In this repository, there is a package that holds functions necessary for the critical analysis of the datasets presented by Gardner MK, et al. The analysis folder contains worked-through notebooks of our data analysis pipeline.
